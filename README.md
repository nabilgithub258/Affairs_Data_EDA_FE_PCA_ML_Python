## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze the "Affairs" dataset to uncover patterns and relationships, engineer new features to improve model performance, and develop machine learning models to predict the likelihood of individuals having extramarital affairs.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about individuals and their marital status, age, gender, and other personal attributes. It also includes a target variable indicating whether the individual has had an extramarital affair.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Performed comprehensive EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Key steps include:

- Data visualization to understand distributions and correlations.
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Summarizing key statistics.

## Feature Engineering

Created new features to enhance the predictive power of the model. Key steps include:

- Transforming categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
- Scaling and normalizing continuous variables.
- Generating interaction terms and polynomial features.

## Machine Learning Predictions

Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict extramarital affairs. Key steps include:

- Implementing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms.
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

## Results

The models were assessed based on their predictive accuracy and ability to generalize to new data.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the predictors of extramarital affairs and demonstrated the effective application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to a real-world problem.
